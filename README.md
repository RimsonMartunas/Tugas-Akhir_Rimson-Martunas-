Project : Guitar Chord Recognition System Using MFCC and Artificial Neural Network (Backpropagation Neural Network, BPNN)
	The guitar is a musical instrument consisting of several strings and frets that can produce various chords. In this study, a Yamaha C330 guitar with nylon strings was used. Chord sound data were recorded using an external microphone placed approximately 15 cm away from the guitar, with a sampling frequency of 8000 Hz and a recording duration of 2 seconds per chord. The recording environment was a quiet, closed room with minimal background noise, ensuring good signal quality for the recognition process.
	The signal processing began with preprocessing, which included signal normalization, signal trimming, frame blocking, windowing, and Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain the frequency spectrum. Feature extraction was then performed using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) to efficiently represent the frequency characteristics of each chord.
	The dataset consisted of 7 major chords (C, D, E, F, G, A, B). Each chord had 3 different variations, and each variation was recorded 50 times. From the 50 recordings per variation, 30 recordings were used for training and 20 recordings for testing. 
	The extracted MFCC features were then used as input for the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN).
